-- ===========================================
-- Seed Data for Local Development
-- ===========================================
-- This file runs automatically after migrations during `supabase db reset`

-- Note: We can't seed user data directly because auth.users requires
-- proper signup flow. The seed data below will be created after you
-- sign up your first user in the app.

-- Example: After signing up, you can run this to create test data:
--
-- INSERT INTO projects (name, slug, owner_id)
-- VALUES ('My Test Project', 'my-test-project', '<your-user-id>');
